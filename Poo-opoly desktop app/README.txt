This is a project I created with FreeSimpleGUI (a for of pysimplegui after it was no longer free).
Used python 3.11.9

The app scrapes the web for aussie supermarket catalogue data and turns it in to a more usable form.
Note, the scraping script may not work for you because I hard coded the location cookies. You could probably get it to work
if you screwed around with them enough.
